# Thyroid-Disease-Prediction using Machine Learning
Nowadays, thyroid disease is increasing rapidly all over the world. Significantly, one out of ten people is affected by the thyroid in India. In recent
years, many researchers have done various research works on thyroid disease
detection. Therefore, the early stage of thyroid disease prediction is difficult
to protect and avoid the worst health condition. In this regard, the machine
learning plays a crucial role to detect the disease accurately. We consider the
UC Irvin knowledge discovery dataset. So, this paper proposes the XGBoost
algorithm to predict thyroid disease accurately. The best features are selected
using XGBoost function. The proposed XGBoost algorithmâ€™s efficacy is
compared to decision tree, logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
methods. The performance of all four algorithms is compared and analyzed.
It is observed that the accuracy of the XGBoost algorithm increases by 2%
than the KNN algorithm.
